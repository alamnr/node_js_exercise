You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Step-1 (Create a private key): The openssl utility can create a private key on the command line like this:

$ openssl genrsa -out my_key.pem 1024

Step-2 (Generate a Certificate Signing Request): Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file.This will create a CSR file named my_csr.pem, but first you will need to answer some identification questions prompted by openssl. This can be done by:

$ openssl req -new -key my_key.pem -out my_csr.pem

Step-3( Create self signed certificate with the CSR):To create a self-signed certii  cate with the CSR, you can do this:

$ openssl x509 -req -in my_csr.pem -signkey my_key.pem -out my_cert.pem


*********************************************************************************


TLS relies on the public/private key infrastructure where each client and server must have a private 
key to sign messages. The openssl utility can create a private key on the command line like this:
$ openssl genrsa -out my_key.pem 1024
This creates a i  le named my_key.pem with your private key.
Generating a Public Key
Servers and clients involved in TLS must have a certii  cate if they are validating each other. 
Certii  cates are public keys signed by a Certii  cate Authority or are self-signed. The i  rst step in 
getting a certii  cate is to create a Certii  cate Signing Request (CSR) i  le. This can be done by:
$ openssl req -new -key my_key.pem -out my_csr.pem
This will create a CSR i  le named my_csr.pem, but i  rst you will need to answer some identii  cation 
questions prompted by openssl.
To create a self-signed certii  cate with the CSR, you can do this:
$ openssl x509 -req -in my_csr.pem -signkey my_key.pem -out my_cert.pem
This will create a self-signed certii  cate i  le named my_cert.pem based on your private key and your 
certii  cate request. Alternatively you can send the CSR to a Certii  cate Authority for signing, but for 
you to work on this chapter’s examples, a self-signed certii  cate is enough.
